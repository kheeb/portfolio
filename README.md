# portfolio
    My goal was to make a responsive portfolio to house a collection of my projects and information
    in one place. I built this project to have an updatable central location for my upcoming work as
    it continues to be developed, so then I won't lose track of any special projects. In this project,
    I learned how to apply IDs, create links within images, and had the chance to practice CSS skills
    like hover, flexbox, and root variables.
